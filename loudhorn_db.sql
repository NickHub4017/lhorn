Today Uber launched the beta of a new flat-fee long-distance uberPOOL option aimed at commuters. It offers pre-priced shared trips into bustling San Francisco from the outlying cities of Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose from 6am to 10am.\n\nFor example, the Palo Alto to SF ride this morning was set at $20. The idea is that by showing the riders the cost up front, they can calculate whether it’s a better deal than the cost of driving.\n\nIf Uber can make carpooling to work cheaper than the gas plus parking plus stress of commuting, car ownership unravels. The other core use case is adults carting their kids around, so I’d expect Uber to continue to get more serious about addressing that market too. This is Uber’s first state-side commuter-focused product, following the September test launch of UberCommute in China, which lets drivers pick up other passengers on their own way to work.\n\npool-to-sf-beta-1\n\nTechCrunch’s Nitesh Kulkarni spotted the test this morning offering a ride from Stanford to SF for $20. When asked about it, Uber’s Bay Area General Manager Wayne Ting wrote, “We are piloting uberPOOL as an option from the Peninsula to San Francisco during the morning commute to ease the hassle and expense of driving into the city. With more folks sharing rides, we can make the price point more affordable, help get cars off the road and ease congestion.”\n\nFrom 6am to 10am, Monday to Friday, Uber users in the eligible areas will see a “Pool To SF” option where they select their ride type. The price will be locked in and shown to the user up front so unexpected traffic won’t jack up the cost. Fares will average $20 from Palo Alto, $22 from Mountain View, and $26 from San Jose. Adding a second passenger only increases the price $10, so you could split a car from Palo Alto to SF for just $15 each.\n\nPOOL-TO-SF-copy\n\nOn the driver side, Uber has gotten drivers who often take the route to opt in to accepting these fares. This way you won’t get a driver angrily cancelling on you for making them drive a long trip. If the program is successful, you can imagine Uber rolling the commuter option to other markets like New York or Los Angeles.\n\nThe closest thing Uber’s stateside competitor Lyft has done is courting drivers by allowing them to set their own commute’s destination so they can get paid for picking someone up along the way. It’s a predates Uber’s similar UberCommute product. Google’s Waze has tested a shared trip feature for commuters, and startup called Ride is focused on carpooling for co-workers. In China, Uber’s big rival Didi Kuaidi is testing full-sized commuter shuttles running fixed routes.\n\npool-pickup-zone (1)\n\nCreating More Key-Droppers\n\nUber got its start replacing taxis for short trips and making on-demand transportation so affordable that it unlocked movement inside big cities. Negotiations to operate at airports like McCarran in Las Vegas expanded Uber into a last-few-miles solution for travelers.\n\nBut now, Uber is aiming to disrupt our longest regular drives. Some people with enough money were already using it to take $80 rides to the office when they were late, needed to work on the way, or were just sick of traffic. But by opening the cheaper uberPOOL for commuters, it could convince a much broader swath of the population to drop their car keys.', 5, 'ArticleImages\\thumbnails\\3.jpg', 'http://www.bbc.com/', 1, 'saj', '2015-10-07 00:34:04', 'Approve'),

Today Uber launched the beta of a new flat-fee long-distance uberPOOL option aimed at commuters. It offers pre-priced shared trips into bustling San Francisco from the outlying cities of Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose from 6am to 10am.\n\nFor example, the Palo Alto to SF ride this morning was set at $20. The idea is that by showing the riders the cost up front, they can calculate whether it’s a better deal than the cost of driving.\n\nIf Uber can make carpooling to work cheaper than the gas plus parking plus stress of commuting, car ownership unravels. The other core use case is adults carting their kids around, so I’d expect Uber to continue to get more serious about addressing that market too. This is Uber’s first state-side commuter-focused product, following the September test launch of UberCommute in China, which lets drivers pick up other passengers on their own way to work.\n\npool-to-sf-beta-1\n\nTechCrunch’s Nitesh Kulkarni spotted the test this morning offering a ride from Stanford to SF for $20. When asked about it, Uber’s Bay Area General Manager Wayne Ting wrote, “We are piloting uberPOOL as an option from the Peninsula to San Francisco during the morning commute to ease the hassle and expense of driving into the city. With more folks sharing rides, we can make the price point more affordable, help get cars off the road and ease congestion.”\n\nFrom 6am to 10am, Monday to Friday, Uber users in the eligible areas will see a “Pool To SF” option where they select their ride type. The price will be locked in and shown to the user up front so unexpected traffic won’t jack up the cost. Fares will average $20 from Palo Alto, $22 from Mountain View, and $26 from San Jose. Adding a second passenger only increases the price $10, so you could split a car from Palo Alto to SF for just $15 each.\n\nPOOL-TO-SF-copy\n\nOn the driver side, Uber has gotten drivers who often take the route to opt in to accepting these fares. This way you won’t get a driver angrily cancelling on you for making them drive a long trip. If the program is successful, you can imagine Uber rolling the commuter option to other markets like New York or Los Angeles.\n\nThe closest thing Uber’s stateside competitor Lyft has done is courting drivers by allowing them to set their own commute’s destination so they can get paid for picking someone up along the way. It’s a predates Uber’s similar UberCommute product. Google’s Waze has tested a shared trip feature for commuters, and startup called Ride is focused on carpooling for co-workers. In China, Uber’s big rival Didi Kuaidi is testing full-sized commuter shuttles running fixed routes.\n\npool-pickup-zone (1)\n\nCreating More Key-Droppers\n\nUber got its start replacing taxis for short trips and making on-demand transportation so affordable that it unlocked movement inside big cities. Negotiations to operate at airports like McCarran in Las Vegas expanded Uber into a last-few-miles solution for travelers.\n\nBut now, Uber is aiming to disrupt our longest regular drives. Some people with enough money were already using it to take $80 rides to the office when they were late, needed to work on the way, or were just sick of traffic. But by opening the cheaper uberPOOL for commuters, it could convince a much broader swath of the population to drop their car keys.', 4, 'ArticleImages\\devmieimage1.jpg', 'http://www.bbc.com/', 2, '', '2015-10-07 00:34:04', 'Pending'),

Officials said the attacks, which injured more than 200 people (80 of whom seriously), occurred at seven separate venues, including a sports stadium. Police have reported that eight militants died, seven of them via suicide bombings, according to a report by Agence France-Presse. French police said they couldn’t say how many were still at large. BFM television said security forces were still seeking one gunman.\nAs news of the attacks spread across the French capital, people huddled in quiet shock outside bars and cafes as the streets filled with the sound of sirens. Outside the concert venue, local media showed images of bodies shrouded in white sheets lined up on the streets.\nIn some of the latest developments:\nPolice stormed a Paris theater where hostages were being held at a rock concert; four gunmen were killed. Attackers shouted ‘Allahu Akbar,’ according to local media\nA U.S. counter-terrorism official said the attack points to enhanced capacity of jihadist groups as the Syrian civil war escalates\nHollande, who visited venue, told the nation in a televised address that “we must, in these difficult moments, show compassion and solidarity, but we also need to show unity and cool-headedness.”\nFrance shut down all public venues Saturday, from museums to swimming pools, and police advised Parisians to stay indoors\nHollande said he’ll skip the G-20 meeting of the world’s biggest economies starting this weekend in Turkey, and will convene his defense cabinet Saturday morning\nAn additional 1,500 French troops were deployed around the French capital\nPresident Barack Obama and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron expressed solidarity and offered any help needed\nAmerican Airlines held up departures to Paris late Friday\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani has postponed a trip to Italy and France scheduled for this week because of the terror attacks\nThe slaughter in Paris took place against a backdrop of mounting anxiety in Europe and beyond about jihadist extremism, as refugees from Syria pour into the continent. Seventeen people were killed in January in a rampage by gunmen that started at the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine. Two weeks ago, a Russian passenger jet was downed over Sinai by what U.S. and U.K. intelligence says was probably a bomb. On Thursday, suicide bombers killed more than 40 people in Beirut.\n“France has always been aware of the threat but did not anticipate an attack of this scale,” said Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore. “Every successful attack is an intelligence failure. France will now take tougher measures.”\nFrench airports remain open and trains are still running, the Foreign Ministry said.

These reactions are rational, but reminiscent of online shopping circa 2000, which, ironically, might now be more secure than shopping in physical retail stores.\n\nTo understand why device makers are relying on an Internet connection and cloud services, we need to look at how our IoT devices work. We need to understand data sources, processing, device to device communication and, ultimately, how one device can leverage another device.\n\nData sources\n\nAs a maker of climate control devices, there are only a few critical sources of data: humans, their environment (indoor and out) and energy utilities.\n\nThere are humans who have a desire to be comfortable, which boils down to having a certain air temperature, radiant temperature and humidity, among other things. Humans live in a variety of geographies, meaning there are often large differences between what they like inside and actual outdoor conditions. Imparting comfort into a space with a large indoor/outdoor difference takes energy, and because energy is subject to supply and demand forces, using it intelligently means understanding its price at any given time.\n\nLet’s distill these down to some concrete data sources. Phones, as arguably today’s ultimate wearable, are a source of data, including location, both macro level (at home or away) and micro level (in a particular room for more advanced systems like ours). They also provide information from human input, accelerometer movement and, in some cases, their microphone.\n\nDoes every flick of a light switch need to go to the cloud and come back down to turn on your light bulb?\nSensors provide environmental data (indoor and outdoor) about raw physical conditions and, often, because of cost and power constraints, have little-to-no processing onboard. In our case, temperature, humidity, ambient light and more all give a digital view of what is going on in a space. There are external sources of data, as well, like electricity and gas rates from utilities, or weather conditions observed by third parties.\n\nAlready, you can see cases where a system at home can operate most ideally with offsite data sources: phones reporting their location when you run out to get groceries, weather from Yahoo and utility rates from PG&E, for instance. This raw data leads to the next question of where it should be sent and how it should be used.\n\nAll this data needs a place to go. Although you could host a server farm in your home, you probably don’t want to invest in one — economies of scale dictate that Amazon will be much better at it, and configuring your router to accept data pushes alone is the stuff of consumer tech nightmares. An always-on, scalable cloud, redundantly backed up on Amazon, is much better than virtually anything you might practically have in your home.\n\nProcessing\n\nBut what about processing? Something needs to take your physical GPS location, understand how it relates to your home’s location and translate that into how long it will take you to get back if you left now. It needs to combine this with information about how long it takes to make your apartment comfortable in different weather conditions, then adjust the set point accordingly.\n\nThis logic is complex, and only gets more complicated when you add more data sources from sensors and context (time of day, sunlight, etc.). Again, you could host a server at home that processes this, but a server must exist for each IoT device or needs to host “apps” for each device in the home. One might argue this is precisely what smart hubs do (or should do), but as numerous hubs have cropped up, is it practical for every device maker to build an app for every hub just so that it can consume data from external data sources?\n\nInternet companies need to meet 5 nines-support levels more than ever.\nEffectively, the storage space on a smart hub is 0 compared to an infinitely scalable database on a cloud service, and you often want your processing in close proximity to your data to avoid wasteful data transport. Sure, you don’t need temperature data every second, but think about the amount of data coming from your Dropcam and how much processing is needed to turn that video stream into actionable notifications and triggers for automation.\n\nCommunication\n\nAnd what about how devices talk to one another. Does it really make sense for every device to have a Wi-Fi chip in either itself or in a gateway, or should all devices route through some always-connected gateway? Based on the growing number of “standards,” varying power, range and data rate requirements, it’s evident there is likely not going to be any sort of IoT topological convergence. This is because, in some cases, a device simply needs to report its proximity to a phone (think beacons), or because a device operating in a challenging R', 0, 'ArticleImages\\thumbnails\\10003.png', 'http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/05/can-you-take-the-internet-out-of-the-internet-of-things/', 2, 'saj', '2016-03-06 09:38:35', 'Approve'),
